## Reference System

### Context

The Reference System (RS) is a key component of the Copernicus Space Component (CSC) Ground Segment: it provides to the community a complete and open source processing and distribution environment software. Integrated with the Sentinel Data Processors, it has the capacity to substitute the nominal CSC Production and Distribution services. 

The Reference System Service is hosted on a secure Public Commercial Cloud and provides 3 operational functions:

- environment to assure the test, integration, validation, benchmarking of Sentinel Data Processors (new processor versions, new user level data, new Sentinel units);
- sampled systematic Production and Distribution Service;
- ad-hoc Production and Distribution Service.

This software is the exact complement of the ESA-driven Sentinel Data Processors. It provides all the components to integrate them in processing chains and to distribute the output products.
